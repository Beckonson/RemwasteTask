Find or Create very simple react and node js apps that have some functionality that you want to test in order to show your skills. Be creative.

Asserting presence of expected data after actions.
2. API Test Automation (Node.js Backend)

Use a tool like Postman/Newman, Supertest, or REST-assured.

POST /login
GET /items
